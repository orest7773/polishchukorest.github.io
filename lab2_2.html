As stated earlier, Elon was born in South Africa. His father, Errol Musk, was a pilot, sailor and electromechanical engineer. His mother, Maye Musk, was a dietician and a model, who was originally from Canada. Musk had two younger biological siblings, Kimbal Musk and Tosca Musk. Kimbal has worked with Elon at various times in his entrepreneurial journey. He is also a member of the board in one of Elon’s numerous companies. Kimbal owns a chain of restaurants. Tosca, meanwhile, is a filmmaker and producer. She has released a few movies under her company, Musk Entertainment.

It seems the ever-evolving businessman has had as many relationships as he has business ventures. So far, the man has been in five relationships, with four different people.
<br></br>
Musk met Justine Wilson, a Canadian author at the Queen’s University campus in Ontario where they were both students. The pair started dating and married in 2000. Justine would later have five sons for Musk – twins in 2004, and triplets in 2006 – through in vitro fertilization. They had lost their first child before these five children came along. The couple divorced in 2008 and share custody of the kids.

Musk started seeing Talulah Riley, an English actress in 2008. They wedded in 2010 and divorced in early 2012. They got back together in July 2013 and divorced for a second time in late 2016. Next came American actress Amber Heard in 2016, however, their heavy career schedules meant they had to split after one year. In May 2018, Elon announced that he was in a relationship with Canadian songstress Grimes.
